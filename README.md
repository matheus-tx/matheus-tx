# Hi there üëã
Hi everyone! I'm Matheus Teixeira. Here's what you need to know about me in a nutshell:
* üë®üèΩ‚Äçüéì I have a bachelor's degree in Statistics. I studied it at Universidade Federal do Cear√°, in Brazil;
* üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª I currently work as a Data Analyst in retail;
* üìà I make a post-grad in Data Science at XP Educa√ß√£o;
* üöÄ I'm currently learning how to deal better with Big Data, with tools such as Hadoop and Spark;
* ‚òÅÔ∏è I plan to learn more about cloud computing in near future;
* ü§© Besides that, I am a huge fan of Bayesian Statitics (although I'm not Bayesian), Deep Learning and Julia.

## Projects

I currently have one project on GitHub:
* **age-prediction**: a Keras model that predicts your age based on picture of your face. It is based on VGGFace. You can also find more about how I came to this model on this [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matheustx/vggface-for-age-prediction). If you have have ideas on how to improve this project, feel free to contact me!

Of course, I'll add more projects here as I have more and fun and interesting ideas.
